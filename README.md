## <i>Installation</i>

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/UznetDev/Global-Internet-users.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Global-Internet-users
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

To run the dashboard, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run üè†_Home.py
```

This will start the application, and you can view it in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port).

## Project Structure

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.
- `build_data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for building, cleaning and processing the dataset.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the dataset files used for the dashboard.
- `function.py`: Contains functions used across the project.
- `üè†_Home.py`: The main script to run the web application.
- `loader.py`: Script responsible for loading data into the application.
- `pages/`: Directory containing the different pages of the web application.
    - **1_üó∫Ô∏èMap.py**: This module contains the code for displaying a global map with various statistical overlays. It visualizes geographical data and provides interactive map features.
    - **2_ üìäStatistics_by_country.py**: This module provides statistical data breakdowns by country. Users can select a country and view detailed statistics relevant to that country.
    - **3_üéØ_Future_Product.py**: This module is designed for future product implementations. It serves as a placeholder for features that are planned for future releases.
    - **__init__.py**: This file indicates that the `pages` directory is a Python package.


### Detailed Breakdown

- **.gitignore**: Configuration file to specify untracked files that Git should ignore.
- **build_data.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing. This includes steps to clean, transform, and prepare data for visualization.
- **dataset/**: This folder holds raw and processed data files necessary for generating statistics.
- **function.py**: This module contains reusable functions that are utilized in various parts of the project to ensure modularity and code reuse.
- **üè†_Home.py**: The entry point for the web application. Running this script launches the dashboard.
- **loader.py**: Handles data loading operations. This script ensures that the data from the `dataset` directory is correctly loaded and ready for use in the application.
- **pages/**: Contains different page modules for the web application. Each page is a separate component/module that can be accessed through the dashboard interface.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Matplotlib**: For making Dashboard.
- **jupyter**: For interactive computing and developing the `build_data.ipynb` notebook.

These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using the installation instructions provided above.
